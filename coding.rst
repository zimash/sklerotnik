====
O(n)
====
* binary search in alphabetically ordered list - worst case O(log2(n)), also known as log time.
* simple search in alphabetically ordered list - worst case O(n), also known as linear time.
* fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort - O(n * log(n)).
* slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort - O(n^2).
* really slow algorithm, like traveling salesperson - O(n!).
